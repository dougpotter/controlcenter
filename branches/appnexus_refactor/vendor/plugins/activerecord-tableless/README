ActiveRecord Tableless
----------------------

<DEPRECATED_NOTICE>

This library is no longer maintained and not recommended for general use. 
With Rails 3.0 on the way, and the new ActiveModel::Validations mixin,
the library becomes worthless.

Until Rails 3.0 is released you might want to consider looking at the excellent
Validator [1] gem from Jay Fields that provides the same functionality (in
terms of validations) but doesn't require ActiveRecord at all.

I've updated the gemspec so that this gem will not work with ActiveRecord 3.0
or later.

1 - http://validatable.rubyforge.org/

This was my first gem ever, so it will be surely missed.

</DEPRECATED_NOTICE>

A single implementation of the ActiveRecord Tableless Model pattern for any
Rails project or other Ruby project that uses ActiveRecord.

Define a model like this:

class ContactMessage < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_no_table
  column :name, :string
  column :email, :string
  validates_presence_of :name, :email
end

You can now use the model in a view like this:

<%= form_for :message, @message do |f| %>
  Your name: <%= f.text_field :name %>
  Your email: <%= f.text_field :email %>
<% end %>

And in the controller:

def message
  @message = ContactMessage.new
  if request.post?
    @message.attributes = params[:message]
    if @message.valid?
      # Process the message...
    end
  end
end
