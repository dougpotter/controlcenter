require 'ruote/exp/flowexpression'


module Ruote::Exp

  #
  # This expression executes its children expression according to a cron
  # schedule or at a given frequency.
  #
  #   cron '15 4 * * sun' do # every sunday at 0415
  #     subprocess :ref => 'refill_the_acid_baths'
  #   end
  #
  # or
  #
  #   every '10m' do
  #     send_reminder # subprocess or participant
  #   end
  #
  # The 'tab' or 'interval' attributes may be used, this is a bit more verbose,
  # but, for instance, in XML, it is quite necessary :
  #
  #   <cron tab="15 4 * * sun">
  #     <subprocess ref="refill_the_acid_baths" />
  #   <cron>
  #
  # Triggered children subprocesses are 'forgotten'. This implies they
  # will never reply to the cron/every expression and they won't get cancelled
  # when the cron/every expression gets cancelled (the cron/every schedule
  # gets cancelled though, no new children will get cancelled).
  #
  # "man 5 crontab" in the command line of your favourite unix system might
  # help you with the semantics of the string expected by the cron expression.
  #
  #
  # == an example use case
  #
  # The cron/every expression appears often in scenarii like :
  #
  #   concurrence :count => 1 do
  #
  #     participant 'operator'
  #
  #     cron '0 9 * * 1-5' do # send a reminder every weekday at 0900
  #       notify 'operator'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # With a subprocess, this could become a bit more reusable :
  #
  #   Ruote.process_defintion :name => 'sample' do
  #
  #     sequence do
  #       with_reminder :participant => 'operator1'
  #       with_reminder :participant => 'operator2'
  #     end
  #
  #     define 'with_reminder' do
  #       concurrence :count => 1 do
  #         participant '${v:participant}'
  #         cron '0 9 * * 1-5' do # send a reminder every weekday at 0900
  #           notify '${v:participant}'
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
