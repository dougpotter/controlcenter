require 'ruote/exp/iterator'


module Ruote::Exp

  #
  # The 'add_branches'/'add_branch' expression can be used to add branches
  # to a concurrent-iterator while it is running.
  #
  #   concurrent_iterator :on => 'a, b, c' do
  #     sequence do
  #       participant :ref => 'worker_${v:i}'
  #       add_branches 'd, e', :if => '${v:/not_sufficient}'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # In this example, if the process level variable 'not_sufficient' is set to
  # true, workers d and e will be added to the iterated elements.
  #
  # 'add_branches' understand comma-separated list of values or direcltly
  # array of values, like the concurrent_iterator does. The :sep or :separator
  # attribute can be used for custom separators :
  #
  #   add_branches 'd|e|f', :sep => '|'
  #
  #
  # == :ref
  #
  # By default, add_branches looks up the first parent expression that is
  # concurrent_iterator. This is all well, but what when you have nested
  # concurrent_iterator and want to hit the enclosing one from inside the
  # enclosed one ? Or when you want to add branches from somewhere else
  # in the process instance, outside of the concurrent_iterator ?
  #
  #   concurrence do
  #
  #     concurrent_iterator :on => 'a, b, c', :tag => 'main' do
  #       subprocess :ref => 'perform_work'
  #     end
  #
  #     sequence do
  #       subprocess :ref => 'supervise_work'
  #       add_branches 'd, e', :ref => 'main', :if => '${f:more_cowbell}'
  #       rewind :if => '${f:more_cowbell}'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The add_branches expression refers to the 'main' concurrent_iterator via
  # the :ref => 'main' attribute.
  #
  #
  # == missing concurrent_iterator
  #
  # If :ref points to nothing or add_branch has no :ref and is not placed
  # inside of a concurrent_iterator, the expression will silently have no
  # effect.
