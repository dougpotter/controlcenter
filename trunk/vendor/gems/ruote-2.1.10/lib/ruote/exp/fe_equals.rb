module Ruote::Exp

  #
  # This expression fell out of favour a long ago. At first it was used with
  # the 'if' expression :
  #
  #   _if do
  #     equals :field_value => 'customer', :other_value => 'British Petroleum'
  #     participant :ref => 'Allister'
  #   end
  #
  # but lately, the :test attribute of the 'if' expression is used :
  #
  #   _if :test => '${f:customer} == British Petroleum' do
  #     participant :ref => 'Allister'
  #   end
  #
  # In some cases, the 'if' expression vanishes and the :if attribute shared
  # by all expressions is used :
  #
  #   participant :ref => 'Al', :if => '${f:customer} == British Petroleum'
  #
  #
  # == attributes
  #
  # The 'equals' expression accepts those attributes :
  #
  # * :value
  # * :field_value
  # * :variable_value
  # * :val
  # * :field_val
  # * :variable_val
  #
  # and
  #
  # * :other_value
  # * :other_field_value
  # * :other_variable_value
  # * :other_val
  # * :other_field_val
  # * :other_variable_val
  #
  # With a bit of luck, they make sense on their own.
