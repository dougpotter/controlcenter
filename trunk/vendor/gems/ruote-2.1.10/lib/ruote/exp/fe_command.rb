require 'ruote/exp/command'


module Ruote::Exp

  #
  # This class gathers the 'skip', 'back', 'jump', 'rewind', 'continue' and
  # 'break' expressions which are used inside of the 'cursor' and 'repeat'
  # (loop) expressions.
  #
  # Look at the 'cursor' expression Ruote::Exp::Cursor for a discussion of
  # each of those [sub]expressions.
  #
  # The expression that understand commands are 'cursor', 'repeat' ('loop') and
  # 'iterator'.
  # 'concurrent_iterator' does not understand commands since it fires all its
  # branches when applied.
  #
  # == :ref => 'tag'
  #
  # It's OK to tag a cursor/loop/iterator with the :tag attribute and then
  # point a command to it via :ref :
  #
  #   concurrence do
  #
  #     cursor :tag => 'main' do
  #       author
  #       editor
  #       publisher
  #     end
  #
  #     # meanwhile ...
  #
  #     sequence do
  #       sponsor
  #       rewind :ref => 'main', :if => '${f:stop}'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # This :ref technique may also be used with nested cursor/loop/iterator
  # constructs :
  #
  #   cursor :tag => 'main' do
  #     cursor do
  #       author
  #       editor
  #       rewind :if => '${f:not_ok}'
  #       _break :ref => 'main', :if => '${f:abort_everything}'
  #     end
  #     head_of_edition
  #     rewind :if => '${f:not_ok}'
  #     publisher
  #   end
  #
  # this example features two nested cursors. There is a "_break" in the inner
  # cursor, but it will break the main 'cursor' (and thus break the whole
  # review process).
  #
  # :ref works with the 'iterator' expression as well.
