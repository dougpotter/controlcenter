  # == options
  #
  # * :server - the IP address or hostname of the SMTP server/gateway (defaults to '127.0.0.1')
  # * :port - the port of the SMTP server/gateway (defaults to 25)
  # * :from - the from mail address (mandatory)
  # * :to - the to mail address[es]
  # * :template - a String template for the mail message
  # * :notification - when set to true, the flow will resume immediately after having sent the email
  #

  # == :template

  #     :no_good_notification,

  #     :notification => true,
  #     :template => "Subject: ${f:email_subject}\n\nno good.")
  #
  # Process variable / workitem field substitution works the same as in
  # process definitions (in this example, the workitem field email_subject will
  # be used as the subject of the email...)
  #
  #
  # == :to or workitem.fields['email_target']
  #
  # The target of the email is either given via the workitem field
  # 'email_target', either by the option :to. The workitem field takes
  # precedence if both are present.
  #
  # This parameter/option may be either a single (string) email address, either
  # an array of (string) email addresses.
  #
  #
  # == final note : mail listener
  #
  # This participant cannot read POP/IMAP accounts for you. You have to
  # use a mail listener or get a web reply by placing a link in the message...
