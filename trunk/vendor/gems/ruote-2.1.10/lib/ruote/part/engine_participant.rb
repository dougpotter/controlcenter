module Ruote

  #
  # A participant for pushing the execution of [segments of] processes to
  # other engines.
  #
  # It works by giving the participant the connection information to the storage
  # of the other engine.
  #
  # For instance :
  #
  #   engine0 =
  #     Ruote::Engine.new(
  #       Ruote::Worker.new(
  #         Ruote::FsStorage.new('work0', 'engine_id' => 'engine0')))
  #   engine1 =
  #     Ruote::Engine.new(
  #       Ruote::Worker.new(
  #         Ruote::FsStorage.new('work1', 'engine_id' => 'engine1')))
  #
  #   engine0.register_participant('engine1',
  #     Ruote::EngineParticipant,
  #     'storage_class' => Ruote::FsStorage,
  #     'storage_path' => 'ruote/storage/fs_storage',
  #     'storage_args' => 'work1')
  #   engine1.register_participant('engine0',
  #     Ruote::EngineParticipant,
  #     'storage_class' => Ruote::FsStorage,
  #     'storage_path' => 'ruote/storage/fs_storage',
  #     'storage_args' => 'work0')
  #
  # In this example, two engines are created (note that their 'engine_id' is
  # explicitely set (else it would default to 'engine')). Each engine is then
  # registered as participant in the other engine. The registration parameters
  # detail the class and the arguments to the storage of the target engine.
  #
  # This example is a bit dry / flat. A real world example would perhaps detail
  # a 'master' engine connected to 'departmental' engines, something more
  # hierarchical.
  #
  # The example also binds reciprocally engines. If the delegated processes
  # are always 'forgotten', one could imagine not binding the source engine
  # as a participant in the target engine (not need to answer back).
  #
  # There are then two variants for calling a subprocess
  #
  #   subprocess :ref => 'subprocess_name', :engine => 'engine1'
  #     # or
  #   participant :ref => 'engine1', :pdef => 'subprocess_name'
  #
  # It's OK to go for the shorter versions :
  #
  #   subprocess_name :engine => 'engine1'
  #     # or
  #   participant 'engine1', :pdef => 'subprocess_name'
  #   engine1 :pdef => 'subprocess_name'
  #
  # The subprocess is defined in the current process, or it's given via its
  # URL. The third variant is a subprocess bound as an engine variable.
  #
  #   engine.variables['variant_3'] = Ruote.process_definition do
  #     participant 'hello_world_3'
  #   end
  #
  #   pdef = Ruote.process_definition do
  #     sequence do
  #       engine1 :pdef => 'variant_1'
  #       engine1 :pdef => 'http://pdefs.example.com/variant_2.rb'
  #       engine1 :pdef => 'variant_3'
  #     end
  #     define 'variant_1' do
  #       participant 'hello_world_1'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
