    doing workitem.fields['__error__'] = [ fei, time, error_message ]

[o] Oleg's idea about participant on_reply
    http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users/browse_thread/thread/2e6a95708c10847b
    on_reply should be done in the receive action, not in Receiver
    thus, in the ParticipantExpression
[x] exp : step (jump to cursor tag ?) : there is already the jump expression
[x] auto-participant re-apply
[o] receiver should be OK with a storage or a context
[x] Avishai : Worker : hook for rejecting the dispatch message
[o] receiver / local participant : reply/forward/proceed/... mess : fix
[o] storage participant : accept string for fei
[o] => Ruote::FlowExpressionId.extract(x)
[o] fei : place engine id in fei.to_storage_id (and back)
[o] wait_for(:inactive) blocks until worker is inactive
[o] storage0.copy_to(storage1) / migrate_to as requested by Matt Nichols

[ ] exp : variable (not really necessary)

[ ] conditional : rprefix ! ${r:x} is perhaps sufficient

[ ] define without name (__result__)

[ ] pooltool.ru

[ ] participant dispatch thread throttling ?

[ ] tailcall
[ ] subprocesses participants (alias ?)

[ ] __command__ + tag (rewind that cursor there, not the current one)

[ ] beanstalk [as a] workqueue ?

[ ] recursion : should cope with modified trees 'main' => :tree ??

[ ] user3 :rif => "!wi.fields['approvers'].include?('user3')" : 'in' operator

[ ] set :var => 'y' { '2342342' }

[ ] pause engine
[ ] pause process instance
    |
    would it mean something like placing a paused list in the storage
    and fetching it all the time ?

[ ] file/fs_listener [example] ?

[ ] tree.to_xml (require builder ?)
[ ] tree.to_rb

[ ] concurrence / concurrent_iterator : merge plugin ?
    use participant for that ?

[ ] restore : implement merge strategies

[ ] one file, no multi-process, persistence ? LateHashStorage ?

[ ] apply : ruby or xml (instead of just ast) ?

[ ] unify ruote/util/json and ruote/util/serializer

[ ] history.to_tree ?

[ ] Ruote.process_definition ... Ruote.method_missing or sequence ?

[ ] concurrence / concurrent_iterator : merge_type => 'discard' / 'ignore'
    keep track of the first "process sub id" ?

[ ] @children diff/undiff idea ?

[ ] write doc about engine options (multi-process !)
[ ] _if '${f:x} == ${f:y} || ${f:x} == ${f:z}'

[ ] document the dollar notation / substitution / extrapolation

[ ] condition : "${f:x} [is] empty" / this one is hard

[ ] ruote/exp/fe_set.rb:147: warning: already initialized constant PREFIX_REGEX

[ ] implement kill_process! (kill_expression! ?)

[ ] engine.force_reply_to_parent(fei) ?

[ ] :on_timeout => :rewind (break, jump to x)...
[ ] rewind 'x' where x is a tagname (command x)

[ ] repeat : have a counter in a variable (:to => x maybe) (subprocessid ?)

[ ] when : add test for cancelling when child has been triggered / is running

[ ] engine.cancel_forgotten_children(wfid) ?

[ ] port subprocess on_cancel test from ruote 0.9 http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users/t/75f02bdadf7b93eb

[ ] double-check on_cancel rewrite (ft_1_process_status)

[ ] verify get_last/get_raw logic, no + 0.0001...
[ ] case exp : smarter one ?
[ ] spare 1 get_msg by caching msg (but keep 'deleting')
[ ] [un]set_var : via message ? should be ok like that... Not much traffic there

[ ] empty iterator or concurrent-iterator, log ? crash ? empty while...
[ ] at expression ?

[ ] remove abort_on_exception=true

[ ] shell ? irb ? Shell.new(storage)
[ ] focus on fulldup or json.dup (via fulldup ?)

[ ] listen to participants/errors/tags {in|out}

[x] engine.on_error = 'participant_name' // 'subprocess_name'
    done at : http://github.com/jmettraux/ruote/commit/50292d954ff877f1f6615022216f346a7001b483
    `--> reverting that for now, too dangerous

[ ]  should __error__ contain the tree ?
[ ] engine.on_cancel = 'participant_name' // 'subprocess_name'

[ ] "business days" plugin

[ ] issue with ruote-kit and inpa participants...

[ ] participant :ref => '${f:nada}', :or => 'xyz'
    (look at OpenWFE manual, this feature already existed in there)
    http://www.openwfe.org/manual/ch06s02.html#expression_participant
    else-ref... list of participants...
    ref="alpha && bravo", ref="alpha||bravo" (|| parallel :( )

[ ] LocalParticipant def consume; handle; reply; end

[ ] lib/ruote/part/participant_list.rb l176 better error message !

[ ] find better solution than "get all schedules"

[ ] worker : minuteman, make it cron triggerable
    trap SIGUSR1 or USR2
    maybe it's expensive to fire a [worker] process each minute
    have to write the $$ (pid) somewhere for cron to pick it up

[ ] detach / attach segments of processes
[ ] clone process ? (could be used by {de|at}tach)

[ ] dollar.rb ${timestamp} ?

[ ] toto :task => 'maw the lawn', :within => '3d'

[ ] solve the ps#root_expression_for(fei) dilemma

[ ] engine.noisy = true shortcut

[ ] re_apply_stalled
    http://groups.google.com/group/openwferu-users/browse_thread/thread/ff29f26d6b5fd135
