= Shpaml-Rails

== Overview

Shpaml-Rails is a Ruby on Rails plugin allowing the use of templates written
in Shpaml syntax with additional shortcuts for ERb as views.

For Shpaml syntax please see {Shpaml reference}[http://shpaml.webfactional.com/tutorial/1].

For ERb shortcuts please see [ERb section of Shpaml-Jinja reference].

== History and Explanation of Parts

Shpaml is a markup processor inspired by and similar to Haml, but with a
more consice syntax, especially concerning attribute specification, and
not tied to any one template engine. For more information about Shpaml, please
refer to {Shpaml homepage}[http://shpaml.webfactional.com/].

Shpaml-Jinja project provides additional markup shortcuts for template engine
specific syntax. One of the template engines supported by Shpaml-Jinja is
ERb (Embedded Ruby).

Shpaml-Rails is a Ruby on Rails plugin that automatically compiles Shpaml
templates using a middleware in development environment and provides Rake tasks
to compile all Shpaml templates in the application in production and test
environments. Shpaml-Rails bundles Shpaml-Jinja and Shpaml scripts and
libraries and requires only an installed Python interpreter (version 2.4 or
higher are tested) to function.

== Installation

Shpaml-Rails may be installed with Subversion or Git.

For an installation with subversion:

  ./script/plugin install http://svn.bsdpower.com/webtools/shpaml-jinja/stable

For an installation with git:

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/p/shpaml-rails.git

Alternatively Shpaml-Rails may be installed as a Subversion external or a Git
submodule, or consider managing it with Piston.

Submodule installation with Git using the stable branch:

  git submodule add -b stable git://github.com/p/shpaml-rails.git vendor/plugins/shpaml-rails

== Usage

Currently Shpaml-Rails compiles Shpaml templates to ERb templates in the
filesystem, that is to say, it is not currently possible to take a Shpaml
template, transform it to ERb in memory and then compile or render ERb.

=== Development Environment

Add the following line to <tt>config/environments/development.rb</tt>:

  config.middleware.use 'Shpaml::DevelopmentMiddleware'

This middleware will scan <tt>app/views</tt> directory of the application for any
Shpaml templates (files ending in <tt>.shpaml</tt>), and compile them to ERb templates
which will be named the same as Shpaml templates minus the <tt>.shpaml</tt> suffix.

It follows that in development environment the user running the code
must have write access to <tt>app/views</tt> subtree.

You may also want to add warning notices to ERb templates generated from Shpaml
templates stating that the generated files should not be edited. This is achieved
by setting <tt>Shpaml::Compiler.aml_generated_warning</tt> setting to true as follows:

  config.after_initialize do
    Shpaml::Compiler.aml_generated_warning = true
  end

This statement should go in <tt>config/environments/development.rb</tt> only.

Important: assignment must be in <tt>after_initialize</tt> block, otherwise it will autoload
<tt>Shpaml::Compiler</tt>, change the setting, but then plugin init will load
<tt>Shpaml::Compiler</tt> again changing the setting back to default.

=== Test environment

Make your testing rake task depend on <tt>shpaml:compile</tt>. <tt>shpaml:compile</tt> will
compile all files ending in <tt>.shpaml</tt> in <tt>app/views</tt> subtree of the application.
All Shpaml templates will be recompiled, even if templates have not changed.

=== Production environment

Add <tt>rake shpaml:compile</tt> to deployment procedure after updating code. For
example:

== Note Concerning Generated ERb Templates

Shpaml-Rails by default removes whitespace between opening tags and
their content, and between content and closing tags. Doing so allows one
to specify content on separate lines, which requires less typing and
may have better readability, yet have it rendered as if it was specified
on the same line as the tag.

An unfortunate side-effect of whitespace removal is that lines in original
Shpaml templates do not directly correspond to lines in generated ERb templates.
For this reason it is recommended to save generated ERb files to the filesystem
and let ERb load them and process them as usual. In case of errors in
template files then the error can be quickly located in generated ERb
template, from which it can be traced back to original Shpaml template.

Future releases of Shpaml-Rails may offer the option of writing line numbers
from original Shpaml template into generated ERb templates.
