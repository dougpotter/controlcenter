= Lazy Sass

== Overview

Lazy Sass is a Ruby on Rails plugin that delays loading of Sass::Plugin
until it is needed, while permitting configuring Sass::Plugin in
environment (config/environment/*.rb).

== Usage

Lazy Sass implements two operations: setting configuration and loading
Sass::Plugin.

=== Setting Configuration

Any options set in LazySass.options will be forwarded to
Sass::Plugin.options when Sass::Plugin is loaded (see the next section).

== Loading Sass::Plugin

Execute LazySass.load! to load Sass::Plugin and forward options set on
LazySass to Sass::Plugin.

It is important to use LazySass.load! instead of just requiring or referencing
Sass so that any options set on LazySass are forwarded to Sass::Plugin.

Lazy Sass is licensed under the MIT license.
