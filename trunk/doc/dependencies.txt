General:

 - rack 1.1.0 for rails 2.3.8
 - pg for using postgres

Control center:

 - fastercsv for generating csv output in reporting
 - haml for compiling sass stylesheets

Extraction:

 - An http client library
   - curb and httpclient are supported
   - using timeouts with curb requires local patch
   - other http client libraries have frontends implemented for them but due to
     various issues are not guaranteed to work
 - right_aws for s3 communication
 - nokogiri for parsing file listings

Testing:

 - factory_girl for fixtures
 - rspec for running tests, and rspec-rails
   - We run rails 2 thus we need rspec 1.x
   - rspec 1.3.0 is required by assertions in some tests
   - rspec-rails 1.3.0 does not work
   - use rspec 1.3.0 and rspec-rails 1.2.9

FakeS3:

 - sinatra
 - builder
 - daemons to run it as daemon
