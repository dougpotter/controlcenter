require 'ruote/exp/flowexpression'


module Ruote::Exp

  #
  # The main names for this expression are 'define' and 'process_definition'.
  # It simply encloses a process definition (and gives it a name and revision
  # if needed).
  #
  #   pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test', :revision => '0' do
  #     sequence do
  #       participant :ref => 'alice'
  #       participant :ref => 'bob'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # It's used for subprocess definitions as well.
  #
  #   pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test', :revision => '0' do
  #     sequence do
  #       buy_food
  #       cook_food
  #     end
  #     define 'buy_food' do
  #       participant :ref => 'alice'
  #     end
  #     define :name => 'cook_food' do
  #       participant :ref => 'bob'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == like a sequence
  #
  # Ruote 2.0 treats the child expressions of a 'define' expression like a
  # 'sequence' expression does. Thus, this
  #
  #   pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
  #     sequence do
  #       buy_food
  #       cook_food
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # is equivalent to
  #
  #   pdef = Ruote.process_definition :name => 'test' do
  #     buy_food
  #     cook_food
  #   end
  #
