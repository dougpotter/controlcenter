require 'ruote/exp/commanded'


module Ruote::Exp

  #
  # This class implements the 'cursor' and the 'repeat' (loop) expressions.
  #
  # The cursor expression is a kind of enhanced 'sequence'. Like a sequence
  # it will execute its child expression one by one, sequentially. Unlike a
  # sequence though, it will obey 'commands'.
  #
  #   cursor do
  #     author
  #     reviewer
  #     rewind :if => '${f:not_ok}'
  #     publisher
  #   end
  #
  # In this simplistic example, the process will flow from author to reviewer
  # and back until the reviewer sets the workitem field 'not_ok' to something
  # else than the value 'true'.
  #
  # There are two ways to pass commands to a cursor either directly from
  # the process definition with a cursor command expression, either via
  # the workitem '__command__' [special] field.
  #
  # == cursor commands
  #
  # The commands that a cursor understands are listed here. The most powerful
  # ones are 'rewind' and 'jump'.
  #
  # === rewind
  #
  # Rewinds the cursor up to its first child expression.
  #
  #   cursor do
  #     author
  #     reviewer
  #     rewind :if => '${f:not_ok}'
  #     publisher
  #   end
  #
  # === break
  #
  # Exits the cursor.
  #
  #   cursor do
  #     author
  #     reviewer
  #     rewind :if => '${f:review} == fix'
  #     _break :if => '${f:review} == abort'
  #     publisher
  #   end
  #
  # === skip & back
  #
  # Those two commands jump forth and back respectively. By default, they
  # skip 1 child, but they accept a numeric parameter holding the number
  # of children to skip.
  #
  #   cursor do
  #     author
  #     reviewer
  #     rewind :if => '${f:review} == fix'
  #     skip 2 :if => '${f:review} == publish'
  #     reviewer2
  #     rewind :if => '${f:review} == fix'
  #     publisher
  #   end
  #
  # === jump
  #
  # Jump is probably the most powerful of the cursor commands. It allows to
  # jump to a specified expression that is a direct child of the cursor.
  #
  #   cursor do
  #     author
  #     reviewer
  #     jump :to => 'author', :if => '${f:review} == fix'
  #     jump :to => 'publisher', :if => '${f:review} == publish'
  #     reviewer2
  #     jump :to => 'author', :if => '${f:review} == fix'
  #     publisher
  #   end
  #
  # Note that the :to accepts the name of an expression or the value of
  # its :ref attribute or the value of its :tag attribute.
  #
  #   cursor do
  #     participant :ref => 'author'
  #     participant :ref => 'reviewer'
  #     jump :to => 'author', :if => '${f:review} == fix'
  #     participant :ref => 'publisher'
  #   end
  #
  # == cursor command with :ref
  #
  # It's OK to tag a cursor/repeat/loop with the :tag attribute and then
  # point a command to it via :ref :
  #
  #   concurrence do
  #
  #     cursor :tag => 'main' do
  #       author
  #       editor
  #       publisher
  #     end
  #
  #     # meanwhile ...
  #
  #     sequence do
  #       sponsor
  #       rewind :ref => 'main', :if => '${f:stop}'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # This :ref technique may also be used with nested cursor/loop/iterator
  # constructs :
  #
  #   cursor :tag => 'main' do
  #     cursor do
  #       author
  #       editor
  #       rewind :if => '${f:not_ok}'
  #       _break :ref => 'main', :if => '${f:abort_everything}'
  #     end
  #     head_of_edition
  #     rewind :if => '${f:not_ok}'
  #     publisher
  #   end
  #
  # this example features two nested cursors. There is a "_break" in the inner
  # cursor, but it will break the main 'cursor' (and thus break the whole
  # review process).
  #
  # == :break_if / :rewind_if
  #
  # As an attribute of the cursor/repeat expression, you can set a :break_if.
  # It tells the cursor (loop) if it has to break.
  #
  #   cursor :break_if => '${f:completed}' do
  #     participant 'alpha'
  #     participant 'bravo'
  #     participant 'charly'
  #   end
  #
  # If alpha or bravo replies and the field 'completed' is set to true, this
  # cursor will break.
  #
  # :break_unless is accepted. :over_if and :over_unless are synonyms for
  # :break_if and :break_unless respectively.
  #
  # :rewind_if / :rewind_unless behave the same, but the cursor/loop, instead
  # of breaking, is put back in its first step.
  #
  #
  # = repeat (loop)
  #
  # A 'cursor' expression exits implicitely as soon as its last child replies
  # to it.
  # a 'repeat' expression will apply (again) the first child after the last
  # child replied. A 'break' cursor command might be necessary to exit the loop
  # (or a cancel_process, but that exits the whole process instance).
  #
  #   sequence do
  #     repeat do
  #       author
  #       reviewer
  #       _break :if => '${f:review} == ok'
  #     end
  #     publisher
  #   end
  #
